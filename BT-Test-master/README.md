BT-Test
=======

Test project for [BT framework] (https://github.com/f15gdsy/BT-Framework).

It mainly demonstrates how AI code can be written using BT behavior tree framework.

NOTE that there is an improved version of this demo, that features hierarchical behavior tree, and fixes a bug you will find in this demo. [Improved] (https://github.com/f15gdsy/BT-Test/tree/improved)

## Things to Show:
1. Use BT framework to construct an AI for a dummy hero, who

 1. loves to beat Goblin, and

 2. is afraid of Orc, and

 3. escape whenever an Orc is within sight, and

 4. rest when there is no Goblin or Orc in sight.

2. MoveAttackAI is where the behavior tree is constructed.
